•  You have installed the Firebase CLI (version 13.0.0 or a compatible version) globally using npm install -g firebase-tools@13.0.0.
•  You have logged in to your Firebase account using firebase login.
•  You have confirmed that firebase --version returns the correct version.

•  Where to run firebase init: This is a crucial point. You are correct to question whether it should be in the Django project root.
  •  For this testing setup with emulators, running firebase init in the Django project root is acceptable (and simplifies the setup), because we are focusing on local development with emulators only.
  •  Important: For a real production deployment, you would typically have a separate directory structure for your Firebase project (including Cloud Functions) and your Django project.
  •  Since you already ran firebase init in the Django project root, we'll proceed with that assumption for now. But keep in mind the different production deployment scenario.

Run the command

firebase-init 

in the django project root. Then

 firebase emulators:start
